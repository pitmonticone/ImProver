Determine all real numbers $\alpha$ such that, for every positive integer $n$, the integer
$$
\lfloor \alpha\rfloor + \lfloor2\alpha\rfloor + \cdots + \lfloor n\alpha\rfloor
$$
is a multiple of $n$.
(Note that $\lfloor z\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$.
For example, $\lfloor-\pi\rfloor = -4$ and $\lfloor2\rfloor = \lfloor2.9\rfloor = 2$.)
